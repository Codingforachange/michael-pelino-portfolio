      I translate the mission-first mindset and technical adaptability 
      developed in Iraq into building robust software solutions. Currently 
      transitioning from a background in industrial mechanical repair, 
      Industrial/Residential Construction,
      Petroleum logistics, and Customer Development to Full-Stack development at WGU.
